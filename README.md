# thepalette ðŸŽ¨

A strap on case for [artseyio/thepaintbrush](https://github.com/artseyio/thepaintbrush).

## Strapping
The gaps allow for a material less than 4 mm thick to be used for a strap.

If using a rope or shoelace to attach the palette, I've found a [round turn and two half hitches](https://www.animatedknots.com/round-turn-two-half-hitches-knot) for a fixed side and a [clove hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/clove-hitch-knot-half-hitches) for the working end work well.

## 3D Printing
I recommend 3D printing the stl at the following settings:
### Filament
PLA or similar
### Nozzle Diameter
0.4 mm or smaller
### Layer Height
0.2 mm or less
### Infill
20% or more
### Supports
On
